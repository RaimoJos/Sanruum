# Sanruum HealthAI

**Empowering Your Health Journey**

## Overview

Sanruum HealthAI is an innovative Python project designed to harness artificial intelligence for
healthcare services—starting with diabetes management and diabetic neuropathy.
*(Currently a console-based application featuring text and speech output; work in progress.)*

## Inspiration and Motivation

After a personal struggle with diabetes, this project was born from a commitment to help others
avoid the pitfalls of delayed diagnosis and inadequate care. Sanruum HealthAI is dedicated to:

- **Early Intervention:** Alerting users to potential health issues before they become critical.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly syncing data from health devices and mobile apps.
- **Accessibility:** Making advanced health insights available and affordable to all.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Analysis:** Leverages machine learning to provide personalized health insights.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Designed to sync with devices (like Contour Plus Elite glucometers) for
  up-to-date health tracking.
- **Predictive Alerts:** Uses data trends to warn users of potential complications.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Planned expansion to support additional diseases and smart home
  integrations.

## Roadmap

- **MVP (Alpha) Release:** Implement basic functions for user data collection, simple health
  alerts, and text/speech interaction.
- **Beta Release:** Gather user feedback, refine core algorithms, and add initial integrations.
- **Advanced Release:** Expand features to include comprehensive device integrations, predictive
  alerts, and broader disease support.
- **Sustainability:** Explore donation options and subscription models to secure funding for
  continuous development.
